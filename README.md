# KrakenBacktesting
Backtesting for cyrpto trading strategies on Kraken

# What does this do? Why was this made?
The intentions of this project was to create an environment that simulates the order books on cryptocurrency markets; I chose Kraken as the market of choice since it was easy enough to pull all of the historical data from a particular trading pair, some markets donâ€™t offer this. What makes this testing library different from other back testing financial libraries is that it was intended to be used for cryptocurrency markets; so instead of relying on particular candle intervals, the precision can go all the way down to a per order book update logic; so you can make the update interval nearly anything you like. It also has different functionality when it comes to placing orders or stop limits; no assumptions are made on the buying or selling of crypto currency, meaning someone must fill your order for it to go through.

# Setup
To run this script you will need 
  * python 3.4
  * Pandas


# How do I use this?
Kraken_rig_runner is a commented example to see the flow of the program:
Typically you want to set your trade logic apart from your indicator or trend declarations.
Using the example plotting file you will get this:

Clearly this isnt a good trading strategy; but it gets the point across for now.

# to-do
